# HopIn 

HopIn is an end-to-end carpool app; built by students, for students.

It is designed specifically to serve university students with unique university credentials, providing a safe and secure ride to campus everyday. Being able to split the cost of ech trip, giving us a great opportunity to save money and time.

"Wow! Thanks HopIn! I hate waking up at 5am every monday to get to my 8am lecture as I live 2 and a half hours bus away from campus.
